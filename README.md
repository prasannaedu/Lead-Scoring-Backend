# Lead Scoring Backend Service üöÄ
This backend service scores leads based on product/offers and prospect data. It combines rule-based logic with AI reasoning (OpenAI) to assign an intent and score to each lead.

‚úÖ Runs locally or on the cloud (Render).  
‚úÖ Accepts CSV uploads.  
‚úÖ Exports scored results automatically.

##  Scoring Logic

### Rule-Based Layer (0‚Äì50 points)

- **Role relevance**: decision maker (+20), influencer (+10), others (0)
- **Industry match**: exact ICP (+20), adjacent (+10), else (0)
- **Data completeness**: all fields present (+10)

### AI Layer (0‚Äì50 points)

- Sends prospect + offer info to OpenAI
- AI classifies intent: High (50), Medium (30), Low (10)
- Provides reasoning for transparency

**Final Score** = `rule_score + ai_points` (0‚Äì100)

---

##  Automation Script

`run_lead_scoring.sh` automates the full workflow:

```bash
./run_lead_scoring.sh
```

**Steps**:
- Upload leads CSV
- Post product/offer
