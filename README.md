## Scoring Logic

### Rule-Based Layer (0-50 points)

- **Role relevance**: decision maker (+20), influencer (+10), others (0)
- **Industry match**: exact ICP (+20), adjacent (+10), else (0)
- **Data completeness**: all fields present (+10)

### AI Layer (0-50 points)

- Sends prospect + offer info to OpenAI
- AI classifies intent (High/Medium/Low) with reasoning
- Maps High = 50, Medium = 30, Low = 10

**Final Score**: `rule_score + ai_points` (0â€“100)

---

## Automation Script

`run_lead_scoring.sh` automates the workflow:

```bash
./run_lead_scoring.sh
```

**Steps**:
- Upload leads CSV
- Post product/offer
- Score leads
- Export scored leads as CSV
